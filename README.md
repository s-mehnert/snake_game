# Snake Gamee

This Snake Game is inspired by the classic Nokia 3310 Snake. 

Press the Start/Restart button to begin a new game. With the left/right/up/down keys you control the snake's direction. The goal is to collect the randomly appearing red balls representing apples being eaten by the snake. Eating an apple increases the score, the length of the snake and the speed of the game. Colliding with a wall or the body of the snake ends the game.
